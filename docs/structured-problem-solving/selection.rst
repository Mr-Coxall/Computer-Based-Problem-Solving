Selection
=========

If computer programs could only do just a linear sequence of steps and nothing else, they would not be very useful. One additional thing that computers are very good at doing is `conditional <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)>`_ control or making a decision, as long as you provide all the parts it needs to figure out the decision. This gives a computer program the ability to make a decision, based on a boolean expression.
