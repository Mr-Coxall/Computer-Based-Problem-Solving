Do While Loop
=============

The Doâ€¦While loop is a repetition structure where the statements inside the loop are executed **at least once**. Only then after being executed once, the Boolean expression is evaluated. If the Boolean expression is true, the body of the loop is executed again and the Boolean expression is re-evaluated once again. Note that this is different from the while loop, where the Boolean expression is at the top. Being at the top in a while loop, it is evaluated first and there might be a circumstance where the Boolean expression is false, right from the beginning. In this case the while loop will never happen. In a Do...While loop, the statements will always happen at least once.

The do...while loop (in most computer programming languages) takes the generic form of:

| **DO**
|    statement(s)
|    counter = counter + 1
| **WHILE** boolean expression

The flowchart for a Do...While Loop will look like this:

The following code snippet is a repetition program. The user enters a positive integer and the program prints out that many lines:
