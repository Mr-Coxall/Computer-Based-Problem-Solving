We have been using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) all along and you have not been aware of it. The foundation of most modern programming languages is built on OOP concepts, to help make programming easier. An example is in python when we generated a random number using something like random.randint(1, 100). Fundamentally under the hood, this is OOP
You did not have to re-write all the code that is needed for the random number to appear and you used the object randoms method randint to get the number. All the properties and methods were written by someone else and you got to just use them. In this section we are going to step back and look at the foundation of OOP and see how it is implemented.
